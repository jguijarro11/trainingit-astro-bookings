# Agents Instructions

## Product Overview
- **AstroBookings** is a backend API for offering bookings for rocket launches.
- Launches are scheduled for specific rockets, with pricing and minimum passenger thresholds.
- Rockets have limited seats; launch requests are validated against rocket capacity.
- Launch status lifecycle: scheduled → confirmed → successful, or cancellation/suspension paths.
- A customer is identified by their email address and has a name and phone number.
- One customer can book multiple seats on a launch but cannot exceed the available seats.
- Customers are billed upon booking, and payments are processed through a mock gateway.

## Technical Implementation

### Tech Stack
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.8
- **Framework**: Express 5.2
- **Database**: In-memory (no database required at the initial stage)
- **Security**: None required at the initial stage
- **Testing**: Vitest 4 (unit) + Playwright 1.59 (E2E/smoke)
- **Logging**: Centralized console logger (`src/logger.ts`) with level filtering via `LOG_LEVEL`

### Development workflow

```bash
# Set up the project
npm install

# Build/Compile the project
npm run build

# Run the project (development)
npm run dev

# Run unit tests in development mode (watch)
npm run test:dev

# Run the project (production, after build)
npm start

# Test the project (unit tests)
npm test

# Test the project (E2E smoke tests)
npm run test:smoke
```

### Architecture Guardrails

- Follow the modular layered architecture defined in `.agents/ADD.md`:
    - `routes` for HTTP transport and validation only.
    - `services` for business rules and orchestration.
    - `repositories` for persistence concerns only.
- Keep domain modules isolated by feature (`rockets`, `launches`, future `customers`, `bookings`, `payments`).
- Do not call repositories directly from routes.
- Return typed domain/service errors and map them to HTTP responses at route level.
- Keep launch lifecycle transitions centralized in `launches.service.ts` using explicit transition maps.
- Preserve launch seat invariants:
    - `totalSeats` is immutable after launch creation.
    - `availableSeats` cannot become negative.
- For booking implementation, enforce this order:
    - Validate customer and launch constraints.
    - Validate seat availability.
    - Process payment through a dedicated adapter.
    - Persist booking only when payment succeeds.
    - Decrement `availableSeats` only after booking persistence.
- Use adapter pattern for external integrations (starting with mock payment gateway) to decouple domain logic from providers.
- Keep all code and documentation in English.

## Environment
- Code and documentation must be in English.
- Chat responses must be in the language of the user prompt.
- Sacrifice grammar for conciseness when needed to fit response limits.
- This is a macOS environment using zsh terminal.
- Mind the available **agent skills** when performing tasks.
- When using templates, ensure to replace {placeholders} with actual values.

### Naming Conventions

Use slugs with hyphens for any identifiers or non code file names.

Use this table to determine the prefixes:

| Spec         | GitHub Label | Git Branch   | Commit |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| feat-<slug>  | enhancement  | feat/<slug>  | feat:  |
| bug-<slug>   | bug          | fix/<slug>   | fix:   |
| chore-<slug> | chore        | chore/<slug> | chore: |

Default git branch is `main`.
